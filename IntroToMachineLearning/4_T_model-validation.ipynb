    "In this lesson, you will learn to use model validation to measure the quality of your model. Measuring model quality is the key to iteratively improving your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is Model Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll want to evaluate almost every model you ever build. In most (though not all) applications, the relevant measure of model quality is predictive accuracy. In other words, will the model's predictions be close to what actually happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people make a huge mistake when measuring predictive accuracy. They make predictions with their *training data* and compare those predictions to the target values in the *training data*. You'll see the problem with this approach and how to solve it in a moment, but let's think about how we'd do this first.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'd first need to summarize the model quality into an understandable way. If you compare predicted and actual home values for 10,000 houses, you'll likely find mix of good and bad predictions. Looking through a list of 10,000 predicted and actual values would be pointless. We need to summarize this into a single metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many metrics for summarizing model quality, but we'll start with one called **Mean Absolute Error** (also called **MAE**). Let's break down this metric starting with the last word, error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction error for each house is: <br>\n",
    "```\n",
    "error=actualâˆ’predicted\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "So, if a house cost \\$150,000 and you predicted it would cost \\$100,000 the error is \\$50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the MAE metric, we take the absolute value of each error. This converts each error to a positive number. We then take the average of those absolute errors. This is our measure of model quality. In plain English, it can be said as\n",
    "\n",
    "> On average, our predictions are off by about X.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate MAE, we first need a model. That is built in a hidden cell below, which you can review by clicking the `code` button."

    "# The Problem with \"In-Sample\" Scores\n",

    "\n",
    "Since this pattern was derived from the training data, the model will appear accurate in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if this pattern doesn't hold when the model sees new data, the model would be very inaccurate when used in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since models' practical value come from making predictions on new data, we measure performance on data that wasn't used to build the model. The most straightforward way to do this is to exclude some data from the model-building process, and then use those to test the model's accuracy on data it hasn't seen before. This data is called **validation data**.\n",
